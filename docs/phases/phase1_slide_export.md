# Phase 1: AI Research Slide Deck Export

**Objective**: Add a professional slide deck export feature to the Research Outcome page, enabling C-suite users to download a condensed, branded presentation of the AI research findings.

## Background

The layman.vuishere.com synthesis pipeline produces a rich set of research data:
- **Executive Summary**: Plain-language strategic overview
- **Ranked Models**: Stack-ranked AI/tech recommendations with capability, ease, and cost scores
- **Pareto Data**: Trade-off visualization points
- **Historical Timeline**: Domain R&D history
- **Implementation Timeline**: Step-by-step rollout roadmap
- **Deep Dive Appendix**: Full research context generated per-domain.

The slide export must present this information at two levels:
1. **Executive Slides** (C-suite): High-level, layman language.
2. **Appendix** (Technical Leads): Full research deep-dives and documentation.

## Slide Structure

| # | Slide | Audience | Content |
|---|-------|----------|---------|
| 1 | Title | All | Query, date, branding |
| 2 | Executive Summary | C-Suite | Strategic recommendation overview |
| 3 | Recommended Models | Leads | All ranked models with scores and rationale |
| 4 | Implementation Timeline| C-Suite | Implementation timeline overview |
| 5+ | Appendix | Leads | In-depth historical context and rationale per domain from backend generation |

## Technology Choice

**Use `pptxgenjs`** (client-side PowerPoint generation via npm package). Rationale:
- Generates real `.pptx` files (opens in PowerPoint, Google Slides, Keynote)
- Can embed images (logo), shapes, gradients, tables natively
- Actively maintained, 15k+ GitHub stars, MIT license
- Avoids PDF canvas rendering complexity (text is selectable, slides are editable)

Alternative considered: `jsPDF` — rejected because tables/charts are harder and output is non-editable.

## Branding Requirements

- **Logo**: `logo.png` from public assets on every slide (top-left badge)
- **Color Palette**: `#0A0A0A` backgrounds, `#10B981` (emerald) accents, white text
- **Typography**: Inter/sans-serif throughout
- **Footer**: "Generated by layman.vuishere.com" on every slide
- **layman.vuishere.com watermark**: Bottom-right on all slides

## Scope

- Backend update to return deep-dive research content via `appendix` field.
- Frontend implementation in `SynthesisReport.tsx`.
- Integration: `SynthesisReport.tsx` gets an "Export Slides" button.

## Verification Steps

1. Click "Export Slides" button on the Research Outcome page
2. Confirm `.pptx` file downloads
3. Open in Google Slides / PowerPoint — verify branding, content, and appendix
4. Verify executive slides are clear and free of jargon
5. Verify appendix contains in-depth documentation text.

## Success Criteria

- File downloads without errors on Chrome and Safari
- All slides rendered with correct data
- Logo present on every slide
- Appendix distinguishable from executive section
