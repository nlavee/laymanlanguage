### **Enterprise-Grade AI Architectural Reasoning**

**layman.ai** is a sophisticated research and orchestration platform designed to translate high-level technical objectives into actionable, multi-domain strategies. By leveraging state-of-the-art Large Language Models (LLMs), it automates the process of domain expansion, deep-dive research, and architectural synthesis.

---

## 🚀 Key Features

- **Multi-Model Orchestration**: Leverages **Claude 4.5 Haiku** for lighting-fast task ingestion and domain planning.
- **Deep Research Specialist**: Utilizes **Claude 4.6 Sonnet** (and other premium models like Gemini 3 Pro) for exhaustive technical deep-dives.
- **Pareto-Optimal Analysis**: Visualizes trade-offs between capability, cost, and complexity using dynamic Pareto frontier mapping.
- **Unified Timeline Generation**: Synthesizes historical context and implementation roadmaps into a cohesive technical narrative.
- **Real-time Activity Streaming**: Watch the AI "think" through Server-Sent Events (SSE) that stream orchestrator logs directly to the UI.

## 📦 Local Development

### **Backend Setup**
1. Navigate to `backend/`
2. Create and active a virtual environment: `python -m venv venv && source venv/bin/activate`
3. Install dependencies: `pip install -r requirements.txt`
4. Start the server: `PYTHONPATH=. python backend/main.py`

### **Frontend Setup**
1. Navigate to `frontend/`
2. Install dependencies: `npm install`
3. Run development server: `npm run dev`
